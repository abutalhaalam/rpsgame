# rpsgame
A rock paper scissors game created in python by github.com/abutalhaalam .
This one is slightly unique as you can choose how many rounds you want to play and the program will loop itself to make that happen.
Currently there isnt a maximum number of round you want to play as I didnt deem it neccessasry.

The program will also stop running if the number of rounds is invalid. 
However the program will not stop running if you choose an invalid option when asked "Whats your choice? 'r' for rock, 'p' for paper, 's' for scissors:", but will only skip that round and move onto the next one.

The program will automatically stop running when the number of rounds hits 0.

The code for the game is on my github:  github.com/abutalhaalam/rpsgame
